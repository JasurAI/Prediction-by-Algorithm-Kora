# Prediction-by-Algorithm-Kora

In this work, I used the Kora algorithm to evaluate whether a strong earthquake occurred in the Fergana Basin by dividing it into 17 small blocks and whether each block was likely to experience a strong earthquake. In this case, 30 parameters were obtained for each block and these parameters were filled with 0 or 1 depending on whether they were specific or not for this block. And the 30th column "Target" indicates whether a strong earthquake occurred in this block or not.

The Data_30 file is an excel file prepared for 17 blocks for earthquake forecasting.
